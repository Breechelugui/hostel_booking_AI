# Capstone Project Summary

## Project Overview
I built a hostel booking system in Rust to learn systems programming. Despite having no Rust experience, I chose it because of its growing popularity and memory safety features.

## Deliverables
- **TOOLKIT.md**: Complete learning guide with setup, code examples, and troubleshooting
- **Working Code**: Functional Rust application with booking logic and AI room suggestions
- **Tests**: Unit tests ensuring code reliability
- **Documentation**: Clear README and inline code comments

## Learning Approach
Used AI tools strategically for concept explanations rather than complete solutions. Key areas where AI helped:
- Understanding Rust ownership and borrowing
- Module organization and project structure
- Error handling with Result/Option types

## Technical Implementation
**Rust Concepts Learned:**
- Ownership and borrowing (hardest part)
- Structs and methods
- Module system and visibility
- Pattern matching
- Error handling

**Features Built:**
- Room suggestion algorithm
- Booking management
- Price calculation
- Simple AI logic with pattern matching

## Project Stats
- 150 lines of Rust code
- 4 modules (main, lib, booking, ai)
- 3 passing unit tests
- Zero external dependencies

## Key Challenges
- Borrow checker errors (spent hours debugging)
- Module system confusion
- Learning Rust testing conventions
- Balancing technical accuracy in documentation

## Reflection
Rust's learning curve is steep, but the safety guarantees make it worthwhile. AI tools were crucial for getting unstuck, but I focused on understanding concepts rather than copying code. Going from zero Rust knowledge to a working application with tests feels like a significant achievement.
